# Landscape Website &#127794;
 I created a fictional landscape business that can be easily navigated through.

<h1>Focal points &#129299;</h1>
<ul>
 <li>I took an image and made it into the logo for a landscaping business. I added the nav-bar with links  </li>
 <li>I added a h1 tag for the heading of the business. I gave the heading container a background that looks like a wood grain pattern. I added an effect because the background stays fixed when the user scrolls down. </li>
 <li> There are hover effects on the buttons and the cards. </li>
 <li> There is also a slideshow gallery that one moves manually using a previous button and next button. Captions were added under the picture where there is dots for navigation as well.</li>
</ul>
